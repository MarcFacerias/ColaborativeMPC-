The bilevel controller consists of a coordination level, where intersection occupancy timeslots are allocated, and a vehicle level, where the control commands for the vehicles are computed. We establish persistent feasibility and stability of the bilevel controller under some mild assumptions and derive conditions under which closed-loop collision avoidance can be ensured with bounded position uncertainty. We thereafter detail an implementation of the coordination controller on a three-vehicle test bed, where the intersection-level optimization problem is solved using a distributed Sequential Quadratic Programing method. We present and discuss results from an extensive experimental campaign, where the proposed controller was validated. The experimental results indicate the practical applicability of the bilevel controller and show that safety can be ensured for large positioning uncertainties.},

   abstract = {Autonomous or teleoperated robots have been playing increasingly important roles in civil applications in recent years. Across the different civil domains where robots can support human operators, one of the areas where they can have more impact is in search and rescue (SAR) operations. In particular, multi-robot systems have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of SAR personnel with faster search of victims, initial assessment and mapping of the environment, real-time monitoring and surveillance of SAR operations, or establishing emergency communication networks, among other possibilities. SAR operations encompass a wide variety of environments and situations, and therefore heterogeneous and collaborative multi-robot systems can provide the most advantages. In this paper, we review and analyze the existing approaches to multi-robot SAR support, from an algorithmic perspective and putting an emphasis on the methods enabling collaboration among the robots as well as advanced perception through machine vision and multi-agent active perception. Furthermore, we put these algorithms in the context of the different challenges and constraints that various types of robots (ground, aerial, surface or underwater) encounter in different SAR environments (maritime, urban, wilderness or other post-disaster scenarios). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first review considering heterogeneous SAR robots across different environments, while giving two complimentary points of view: control mechanisms and machine perception. Based on our review of the state-of-the-art, we discuss the main open research questions, and outline our insights on the current approaches that have potential to improve the real-world performance of multi-robot SAR systems.},

However, few researches addressed the multi-vehicle cooperation during lane change process. In this article, feasibility criteria of lane change are designed, which considers the acceptable acceleration/deceleration of neighboring vehicles; meanwhile, a cooperative lane change strategy based on model predictive control is proposed in order to attenuate the adverse impacts of lane change on traffic flow. The proposed strategy implements the centralized decision making and active cooperation among the subject vehicle performing lane change in the subject lane and the preceding vehicle and the following vehicle in the target lane during lane change. Using model predictive control, safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency are integrated as the objectives, and lane change process is optimized. Numerical simulation results of the cooperative lane change strategy suggest that the deceleration of following vehicle can be weakened and further the shock wave propagated in traffic flow can be alleviated to some degree compared with traditional lane change.},

   abstract = {Vehicle platooning reduces the safety distance between vehicles and the travel time of vehicles so that it leads to an increase in road capacity and to saving fuel consumption. In Europe, many projects for vehicle platooning are being actively developed, but mostly focus on truck platooning on the highway with a simpler topology than that of the urban road. When an existing vehicle platoon is applied to urban roads, many challenges are more complicated to address than highways. They include complex topology, various routes, traffic signals, intersections, frequent lane change, and communication interference depending on a higher vehicle density. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed urban platooning protocol (DUPP) that enables high mobility and maximizes flexibility for driving vehicles to conduct urban platooning in a decentralized manner. DUPP has simple procedures to perform platooning maneuvers and does not require explicit conforming for the completion of platooning maneuvers. Since DUPP mainly operates on a service channel, it does not cause negative side effects on the exchange of basic safety messages on a control channel. Moreover, DUPP does not generate any data propagation delay due to contention-based channel access since it guarantees sequential data transmission opportunities for urban platooning vehicles. Finally, to address a problem of the broadcast storm while vehicles notify detected road events, DUPP performs forwarder selection using an analytic hierarchy process. The performance of the proposed DUPP is compared with that of ENSEMBLE which is the latest European platooning project in terms of the travel time of vehicles, the lifetime of an urban platoon, the success ratio of a designed maneuver, the external cost and the periodicity of the urban platooning-related transmissions, the adaptability of an urban platoon, and the forwarder selection ratio for each vehicle. The results of the performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed DUPP is well suited to dynamic urban environments by maintaining a vehicle platoon as stable as possible after DUPP flexibly and quickly forms a vehicle platoon without the support of a centralized node.},

In conventional path planning algorithms, robots need to search a comparatively wide area for navigation and move in a predesigned formation under a given environment. Each robot in the multi-robot system is inherently required to navigate independently with collaborating with other robots for efficient performance. In addition, the robot collaboration scheme is highly depends on the conditions of each robot, such as its position and velocity. However, the conventional method does not actively cope with variable situations since each robot has difficulty to recognize the moving robot around it as an obstacle or a cooperative robot. To compensate for these shortcomings, we apply Deep q learning to strengthen the learning algorithm combined with CNN algorithm, which is needed to analyze the situation efficiently. CNN analyzes the exact situation using image information on its environment and the robot navigates based on the situation analyzed through Deep q learning. The simulation results using the proposed algorithm shows the flexible and efficient movement of the robots comparing with conventional methods under various environments.},

It is based on the artificial potential approach and the elastic band theory. The assessment of the emergency path is based on the dynamic performances; the yaw rate and the lateral acceleration of the host vehicle are chosen in this paper. In order to make evasion manoeuvres steadier, a guide potential attached at the front of the obstacle vehicle and a guide potential attached at the rear of the obstacle vehicle are built to affect the moving vehicles in such a way that it encourages the host vehicle to change lane appropriately. Meanwhile, a hazard map of the road environment including the borders and the obstacle vehicles is generated. Thus the forces acting on the corresponding nodes of an elastic band should be zero because of the equilibrium condition; the trajectory with a low hazard is calculated via a numerical method. The simulation results show that the approach is acceptable and leads to a successful collision avoidance manoeuvre in various driving situations. © IMechE 2013.},

   abstract = {Artificial potential fields and optimal controllers are two common methods for path planning of autonomous vehicles. An artificial potential field method is capable of assigning different potential functions to different types of obstacles and road structures and plans the path based on these potential functions. It does not, however, include the vehicle dynamics in the path-planning process. On the other hand, an optimal path-planning controller integrated with vehicle dynamics plans an optimal feasible path that guarantees vehicle stability in following the path. In this method, the obstacles and road boundaries are usually included in the optimal control problem as constraints and not with any arbitrary function. A model predictive path-planning controller is introduced in this paper such that its objective includes potential functions along with the vehicle dynamics terms. Therefore, the path-planning system is capable of treating different obstacles and road structures distinctly while planning the optimal path utilizing vehicle dynamics. The path-planning controller is modeled and simulated on a CarSim vehicle model for some complicated test scenarios. The results show that, with this path-planning controller, the vehicle avoids the obstacles and observes road regulations with appropriate vehicle dynamics. Moreover, since the obstacles and road regulations can be defined with different functions, the path-planning system plans paths corresponding to their importance and priorities.},

In particular, we focus our analysis on NMPC based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme, as this technique has been successfully tested and, in some applications, requires computational times that are only marginally larger than linear MPC.

   abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have the potential to enable efficient real-time path planning applications capable of handling congestion traffic problems using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, path planning applications are facing the biggest challenges related to the increase in communication cost caused by redundant communications, which has a destructive impact on the overall network performance. So, the communication design should be carefully adjusted to avoid this problem. In this paper, we propose an effective real-time path planning strategy based on a cooperative information-sharing approach between vehicles and RSUs, which takes into account the communication cost by using a shortest path-based relaying of communications between RSUs to avoid communication redundancy. First, the assigned roles for each item in the network are revised to reduce communication cost, for example, vehicles can share travel time information with RSUs by adopting only single hop communications, especially since each RSU can cover a set of road segments in its surrounding region. Next, we propose a simple shortest path-based routing, which is partially similar to Geographic Source Routing (GSR), but it differs from GSR in the way the vehicles relay communications between each other in road segments as we use the weighted p-persistence broadcasting method to reduce unneeded communication redundancy, while under disconnectivity, a carry-and-forward mechanism is used to allow information sharing with next hop RSUs. Both the proposed path planning strategy and the communication architecture are evaluated according to several scenarios and performance metrics. The simulation results show that our strategy can significantly improve vehicles’ traveling time on the road as well as decreasing communication cost.},

@article{Lee2020,
   abstract = {In truck platooning, the leading vehicle is driven manually, and the following vehicles run by autonomous driving, with the short inter-vehicle distance between trucks. To successfully perform platooning in various situations, each truck must maintain dynamic stability, and furthermore, the whole system must maintain string stability. Due to the short front-view range, however, the following vehicles’ path planning capabilities become significantly impaired. In addition, in platooning with articulated cargo trucks, the off-tracking phenomenon occurring on a curved road makes it hard for the following vehicle to track the trajectory of the preceding truck. In addition, without knowledge of the global coordinate system, it is difficult to correlate the local coordinate systems that each truck relies on for sensing environment and dynamic signals. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, a path planning algorithm for platooning of articulated cargo trucks has been developed. Using the Kalman filter, V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, and a novel update-and-conversion method, each following vehicle can accurately compute the trajectory of the leading vehicle’s front part for using it as a target path. The path planning algorithm of this paper was validated by simulations on severe driving scenarios and by tests on an actual road. The results demonstrated that the algorithm could provide lateral string stability and robustness for truck platooning.},

There exist prior arts using the rule-based high-level decision making approaches to decide the mode switching. Instead of using explicit rules, we propose a unified path planning approach using Model Predictive Control (MPC), which automatically decides the mode of maneuvers. To ensure safety, we model surrounding vehicles as polygons and develop a type of constraints in MPC to enforce the collision avoidance between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles. To achieve comfortable and natural maneuvers, we include a lane-Associated potential field in the objective function of the MPC.

   abstract = {This contribution puts forward a receding horizon control approach for automated driving systems, where tactical-level lane change decisions and control-level accelerations are jointly evaluated under a central mathematical framework. The key idea is that controlled vehicles predictively determine discrete desired lane sequences and continuous accelerations to minimise a cost function reflecting undesirable future situations. The interactions between controlled vehicles and surrounding vehicles are captured in the cost function. The approach is flexible in terms of application to controller design for both non-cooperative control systems where controlled vehicles only optimise their own cost and cooperative control systems where controlled vehicles coordinate their decisions to optimise the collective cost. To determine the controller behaviour, the problem is formulated as a differential game where controlled vehicles make decisions based on the expected behaviour of other vehicles. The control decisions are updated at regular frequency, using the newest information regarding the state of controlled vehicles and surrounding vehicles available. A problem decomposition technique is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem by introducing a finite number of sub-problems and an iterative algorithm based on Pontryagin's Principle is used to solve sub-problems efficiently. The proposed controller performance is demonstrated via numerical examples. The results show that the proposed approach can produce efficient lane-changing manoeuvres while obeying safety and comfort requirements. Particularly, the approach generates optimal lane change decisions in the predicted future, including strategic overtaking, cooperative merging and selecting a safe gap.},

   abstract = {Summary This paper describes autonomous racing of RC race cars based on mathematical optimization. Using a dynamical model of the vehicle, control inputs are computed by receding horizon based controllers, where the objective is to maximize progress on the track subject to the requirement of staying on the track and avoiding opponents. Two different control formulations are presented. The first controller employs a two-level structure, consisting of a path planner and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for tracking. The second controller combines both tasks in one nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) following the ideas of contouring control. Linear time varying models obtained by linearization are used to build local approximations of the control NLPs in the form of convex quadratic programs (QPs) at each sampling time. The resulting QPs have a typical MPC structure and can be solved in the range of milliseconds by recent structure exploiting solvers, which is key to the real-time feasibility of the overall control scheme. Obstacle avoidance is incorporated by means of a high-level corridor planner based on dynamic programming, which generates convex constraints for the controllers according to the current position of opponents and the track layout. The control performance is investigated experimentally using 1:43 scale RC race cars, driven at speeds of more than 3 m/s and in operating regions with saturated rear tire forces (drifting). The algorithms run at 50 Hz sampling rate on embedded computing platforms, demonstrating the real-time feasibility and high performance of optimization-based approaches for autonomous racing.},

   abstract = {In recent years, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been extensively used for solving automotive motion control and planning tasks. In order to formulate the NMPC problem, different coordinate systems can be used with different advantages. We propose and compare formulations for the NMPC related optimization problem, involving a Cartesian and a Frenet coordinate frame (CCF/ FCF) in a single nonlinear program (NLP). We specify costs and collision avoidance constraints in the more advantageous coordinate frame, derive appropriate formulations and compare different obstacle constraints. With this approach, we exploit the simpler formulation of opponent vehicle constraints in the CCF, as well as road aligned costs and constraints related to the FCF. Comparisons to other approaches in a simulation framework highlight the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

   abstract = {To improve the concurrency of leaders’ formation and followers’ containment, a difficult problem of designing the formation controller and the containment controller simultaneously should be addressed for networked systems. Motivated by this, this paper presents an even-triggered control framework for networked Euler–Lagrange systems to achieve formation-containment control even in the presence of uncertain parameters. An event-triggered formation controller is firstly designed for leaders to achieve the desired configuration. An event-triggered containment control law is then developed to guarantee that all the followers can converge to the convex hull formed by leaders. The key feature of the containment control law is that it does not necessitate any relative velocity information with respect to neighbor followers. Each controller's gains are adaptively tuned using only local information. The parametric uncertainties are accommodated by using the adaptive updating law. Zeno behaviors of the triggering time sequences are also excluded. As a result, the communication burden of formation-containment system can be reduced. Numerical simulation is finally presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered formation-containment control framework.},

We adopted the on-demand collision avoidance method presented in previous work to efficiently compute non-colliding trajectories in transition tasks. An event-triggered replanning strategy is proposed to account for disturbances. Our simulation results show that the proposed collision avoidance method can reduce, on average, around 50 of the travel time required to complete a multi-agent point-to-point transition when compared to the well-studied Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC) approach. Additionally, it shows a higher success rate in transition tasks with a high density of agents, with more than 90 success rate with 30 palm-sized quadrotor agents in a 18 m3 arena. The approach was experimentally validated with a swarm of up to 20 drones flying in close proximity.},

@article{Hu2020,
   abstract = {This paper proposes a fully distributed control protocol that achieves time-varying group formation tracking for linear multiagent systems connected via a directed graph. The group formation tracking often leads to sub-formations especially when the leaders are placed far apart or they have separate control inputs. In the proposed approach, the followers are distributed into several subgroups and each subgroup attains the predefined subformation along with encompassing the leaders. Each subgroup can be assigned multiple leaders, contrary to the single-leader case considered in most existing literature, which makes the current problem nontrivial. When multiple leaders exist in a subgroup, the subformation attained by that subgroup keeps tracking a convex combination of the states of the leaders. A distributed adaptive control protocol has been introduced in this paper which uses only relative state information and, thus, avoids direct computation of the graph Laplacian matrix. Due to the virtue of this, the proposed scheme remains effective even when some of the agents get disconnected from the network due to sudden communication failure. An algorithm is provided to outline the steps to design the control law to attain time-varying group formation tracking with multiple leaders. Toward the end, a case study on multitarget surveillance operation is taken up to show an important application of the proposed adaptive control technique.},

   abstract = {Distributed model-predictive controllers provide a robust way to adjust the acceleration of each platoon vehicle and avoid collisions. This is achieved by transforming the control problem into an iterative, finite-horizon optimization with local constraints. However, the derivation of the global optimal solution is not straightforward. In this paper, first, the consensus cost function is formulated, constrained by minimum distance requirements between the vehicles. Then, the solution is derived via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an iterative and robust solver with minimal communication demands. A low-complexity solution is proposed by casting the problem as stochastic control optimization. The developed techniques are evaluated via simulations, where the trajectory of the leading vehicle is generated by an open-source software for autonomous driving (CARLA).},

@article{Sun2020,
   abstract = {Trajectory planning is a fundamental task on various autonomous driving platforms, such as social robotics and self-driving cars. Many trajectory planning algorithms use a reference curve based Frenet frame with time to reduce the planning dimension. However, there is a common implicit assumption in classic trajectory planning approaches, which is that the generated trajectory should follow the reference curve continuously. This assumption is not always true in real applications and it might cause some undesired issues in planning. One issue is that the projection of the planned trajectory onto the reference curve maybe discontinuous. Then, some segments on the reference curve are not the image of any part of the planned path. Another issue is that the planned path might self-intersect when following a simple reference curve continuously. The generated trajectories are unnatural and suboptimal ones when these issues happen. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate these issues and then introduce an efficient trajectory generation method which uses a new transformation from the Cartesian frame to Frenet frames. Experimental results on a simulated street scenario demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

   abstract = {Traffic congestion and energy issues have set a high bar for current ground transportation systems. With advances in vehicular communication technologies, collaborations of connected vehicles have becoming a fundamental block to build automated highway transportation systems of high efficiency. This paper presents a distributed optimal control scheme that takes into account macroscopic traffic management and microscopic vehicle dynamics to achieve efficiently cooperative highway driving. Critical traffic information beyond the scope of human perception is obtained from connected vehicles downstream to establish necessary traffic management mitigating congestion. With backpropagating traffic management advice, a connected vehicle having an adjustment intention exchanges control-oriented information with immediately connected neighbors to establish potential cooperation consensus, and to generate cooperative control actions. To achieve this goal, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme is developed accounting for driving safety and efficiency. By coupling the states of collaborators in the optimization index, connected vehicles achieve fundamental highway maneuvers cooperatively and optimally. The performance of the distributed control scheme and the energy-saving potential of conducting such cooperation are tested in a mixed highway traffic environment by the means of microscopic simulations.},

In this paper, a distributed motion planning strategy based on the artificial potential field method is proposed to achieve overtaking of the autonomous vehicle fleet in dynamic environments. Firstly, a dynamic target tracking control protocol is constructed for an autonomous vehicle fleet using a modified artificial potential field. The target tracking control protocol overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional artificial potential field method (i.e., the dynamic target cannot be reached). Besides, a distributed obstacle avoidance control protocol is also designed to avoid potential collisions during the overtaking process. Finally, simulation experiments are performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we present a method, namely CCA, for collision avoidance in dynamic environments among interacting agents, such as other robots or humans. Given a preferred motion by a global planner or driver, the method computes a collision-free local motion for a short time horizon, which respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control. The method builds on the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacles and extends it to respect the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and account for a grid-based map representation of the environment. The method is best suited for large multirobot settings, including heterogeneous teams of robots, in which computational complexity is of paramount importance and the robots interact with one another. In particular, we consider a set of motion primitives for the robot and solve an optimization in the space of control velocities with additional constraints. Additionally, we propose a cooperative approach to compute safe velocity partitions in the distributed case. We describe several instances of the method for distributed and centralized operation and formulated both as convex and nonconvex optimizations. We compare the different variants and describe the benefits and tradeoffs both theoretically and in extensive experiments with various robotic platforms: robotic wheelchairs, robotic boats, humanoid robots, small unicycle robots, and simulated cars.},
