Solvers of the QCQP problem - only aplicable to the case of quadratic constraints (LPV + plane) 

    We cast the QCQP into the Second Order Cone Problems http://cvxopt.org/userguide/coneprog.html#second-order-cone-programming 

General non linear solvers 

    ipopt solver 

Modelling language 
    Pyomo 
    CVX
    CPLEX
    SCIP -> Mixed Integer non linear programming
